// perf #18 (bead dar-dar6x4-perf-5dq.30): server-side owner of an attached shared-memory ring.
//
// A RingBuffer owns one guest-shared mapping (the dserver_ring_shm control block + the two
// SPSC rings + arena) plus the eventfd the guest signals to wake the server. It is created
// only AFTER dserver_ring_attach_check() has validated the guest's control block, so by the
// time a RingBuffer exists the layout offsets are known-good and bounded. RAII tears the
// mapping + eventfd down on destruction; the owning Thread drops its shared_ptr on death.
//
// The whole type is gated behind DSERVER_RING_TRANSPORT so a default build never references
// it (byte-identical when off).
